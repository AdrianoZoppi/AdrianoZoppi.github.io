			              	<p>
			                Mauro Frisari, aka Shaf Huse, was born in Milan in 1994. As he stated, his first approach to techno music happened at the age of 14: his father used to be a big fan of vinyls,therefore he stored many in their family home. One afternoon he sat in front of them and examined them for about 2 hours without listening to them! When he finally got the chance to actually listen to them he was astonished, phylosophically we could say that his career started that day. Nowadays he is a renowned DJ and his tracks received positive feedback from his colleagues , in fact recetly both the Martinez Brothers and Cuartero played his best track(in my opinion) called "Mavado".
